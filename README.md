Gil32 is motor agnostic racing firmwareâ€¦ no tunning required.

Firmware is unrestricted, meaning it does not limit the flight controller in any way allowing you the pilot to be as aggressive on your inputs and PID tunes without worrying about desyncs, wobbles or flutter, no ramp up, timing advance, or any other compensating setting meant to keep the ESC from desynching.
